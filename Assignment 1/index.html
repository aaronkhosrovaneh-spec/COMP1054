            <p>He's a real nowhere man<br>
            Sitting in his nowhere land<br>
            Making all his nowhere plans for nobody<br></p>

            <p>Doesn't have a point of view<br>
            Knows not where he's going to<br>
            Isn't he a bit like you and me?<br></p>

            <p>Nowhere man, please listen<br>
            You don't know what you're missing<br>
            Nowhere man<br>
            The world is at your command<br></p>

            <p>He's as blind as he can be<br>
            Just sees what he wants to see<br>
            Nowhere man, can you see me at all?<br></p>

            <p>Nowhere man, don't worry<br>
            Take your time, don't hurry<br>
            Leave it all<br>
            'Til somebody else lends you a hand<br></p>

            <p>Doesn't have a point of view<br>
            Knows not where he's going to<br>
            Isn't he a bit like you and me?<br></p>

            <p>Nowhere man, please listen<br>
            You don't know what you're missing<br>
            Nowhere man<br>
            The world is at your command<br></p>

            <p>He's a real nowhere man<br>
            Sitting in his nowhere land<br>
            Making all his nowhere plans for nobody<br>
            Making all his nowhere plans for nobody<br>
            Making all his nowhere plans for nobody</p>

            <h2>About the song</h2>
            <p>'Nowhere Man' is a song about someone with a directionless life, as well as no real worldview. It was one of the first Beatles songs to not be about romance or love. In 1968, the song was featured in the Beatles animated film 'Yellow Submarine', where the group sings the song upon meeting the nowhere man himself in Nowhere Land.</p>
