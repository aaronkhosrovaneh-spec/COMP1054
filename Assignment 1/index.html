            <p>He's a real nowhere man<br>
            Sitting in his nowhere land<br>
            Making all his nowhere plans for nobody<br></p>

            <p>Doesn't have a point of view<br>
            Knows not where he's going to<br>
            Isn't he a bit like you and me?<br></p>

            <p>Nowhere man, please listen<br>
            You don't know what you're missing<br>
            Nowhere man<br>
            The world is at your command<br></p>

            <p>He's as blind as he can be<br>
            Just sees what he wants to see<br>
            Nowhere man, can you see me at all?<br></p>

            <p>Nowhere man, don't worry<br>
            Take your time, don't hurry<br>
            Leave it all<br>
            'Til somebody else lends you a hand<br></p>

            <p>Doesn't have a point of view<br>
            Knows not where he's going to<br>
            Isn't he a bit like you and me?<br></p>

            <p>Nowhere man, please listen<br>
            You don't know what you're missing<br>
            Nowhere man<br>
            The world is at your command<br></p>

            <p>He's a real nowhere man<br>
            Sitting in his nowhere land<br>
            Making all his nowhere plans for nobody<br>
            Making all his nowhere plans for nobody<br>
            Making all his nowhere plans for nobody</p>
